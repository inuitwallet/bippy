#Bippy 
###MultiCurrency Toolkit
#####http://bippy.org

Bippy is a tool for securing crypto-currencies. 
It uses the encryption technique laid out in BIP0038 to secure private keys and custom techniques based closely on BIP0038 to encrypt Mnemonic seeds and Public Addresses
Bippy can also generate vanity addresses by wrapping a customised 'vanitygen' executable. The resulting private key can be BIp0038 encrypted

For more information on how to use    
   - bippy has a simple user interface with helpful instructions to make the encryption process easier.
   - After encrypting a key, bippy can show you copy and paste-able personalised links to woodwallets.io so that you can keep your BIP0038 encrypted key safe in style.
   - bippy does not need an internet connection so private key generation and encryption can be kept secure.
   - bippy aims to be cross-platform on modern operating system, open source, and free.
   
#Running bippy

Ensure that you have kivy installed (or bootstrapped if you are using the portable version on windows. That's all explained at http://kivy.org)
Open a command prompt / terminal in the bippy directory and type *python bippy.py* 

 
#Libraries used

   - kivy (http://kivy.org)
   - scrypt (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/scrypt/0.6.1)
   - deepcelerons' script was the foundation of inuit which in turn led to bippy (https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=361092.0)
